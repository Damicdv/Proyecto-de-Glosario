        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            We are a team of eight 4th-year students from PRoA, united by our passion for programming and the desire to provide a useful tool for those who, like us, are in the process of learning in this field. Our team is made up of a diversity of skills and roles that complement each other to achieve a common goal: to create a programming terminology glossary that is accessible and convenient for anyone who needs quick references.

Each team member has a specific responsibility:</p>
        <p>
            Lionel Juncos and Giuliano Nardi are the developers of the website, who have worked hard on programming the platform to ensure that the site is functional, intuitive, and user-friendly.
Damián Varela is our documentation manager, an essential role to capture each stage of development and ensure that the entire project is properly documented.
Jeremías Vocos and Federico Moyano were the ones who laid the foundation of the page, giving structure and direction to the project from the very beginning.
Joaquín Navarro and Juan Paredes, we are responsible for creating and organizing the content of each glossary section, ensuring that all information is clear, accurate, and accessible.
Finally, Francesco Nardi, in his role as coordinator, ensures that the team stays focused on objectives and meets deadlines, facilitating communication and the workflow.

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The glossary project originated with a simple yet fundamental goal: to create a reliable and accessible source of programming terms and concepts that anyone can quickly consult at any time. By building this glossary as a website, we aim to take advantage of the benefits of online accessibility, allowing users to find the information they need with ease, from any device with an internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>The glossary is exclusively focused on programming, a field that features multiple terminologies and concepts that can often be complex for those who are learning or working in the area. Through this platform, we aim to primarily support students, although anyone who needs a quick reference can benefit. We know that remembering all the technical details and terms is not always easy, especially when one is in the middle of a project or intensive learning process. That's why our intention is for the glossary to serve as a sort of "digital companion" for the user, where they can always find help.
